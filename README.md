# studio

**Please note this is a pre-release version of studio.**

Comments and suggestions for improvement (especially in the form of
patches!) are welcome.

This is _studio_, a small build system for quick bootstrapping of
development efforts. _studio_ is not meant to replace the kind of
build system suitable for handling a large project (such as the code
base of an entire experiment). It is meant as an easy system to allow
the use of such large code bases, and the development of one (or
perhaps even a few) libraries (or even executables).

It is intended for the development of code to be run in the _art_
framework (including the use of code from any experiment using _art_,
or toolkits such as LArSoft that depend upon _art_).
